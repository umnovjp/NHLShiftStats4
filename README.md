# NHLShiftStats4
This repo is update on my previous repo located here: https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftsStats3. I just started doing staff in a different way. Using objects and not arrays. Does not improve too much in fact using object takes more lines than arrays. Copied old script
## Future Development
That's developing pretty well. I am progressing. Developed function lineByLine2 which is absolutely different from lineByLine1. Had some issues with case when team dressed 11F. Hope they are resolved by now.
