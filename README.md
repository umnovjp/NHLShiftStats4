# NHLShiftStats4
This repo is update on my previous repo located here: https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftsStats3. I just started doing staff in a different way. Using objects and not arrays. Does not improve too much in fact using object takes more lines than arrays. Started from scratch. But next plan is to run this process on the server. Old file became just too complicated. I cannot recall what I did. Easier to start from scratch than to recall. And I have more experience now than 3 years ago. 
## Future Development
I do not expect major development in this script. Instead, it will merge to another repo, which is going to run on server. So this is just a temporary repo. I just want to make process mor etransparent. Too many changes, too many tries in the previous repo. I just do not remember what I did. s
