# NHLShiftStats4
This repo is update on my previous repo located here: https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftsStats3. I just started doing staff in a different way. Using objects and not arrays. Does not improve too much in fact using object takes more lines than arrays. Copied old script to start with. 
## Future Development
That's developing pretty well. I am progressing. Developed function lineByLine2 which is absolutely different from lineByLine1. And I found many errors that I did not see before. One example is game on 05/29. Had some issues with case when team dressed 11F. Not resolved in functions lineByLine1, lineByline2. So created lineByLine3 to count case when forwards 9 and 10 played as a line against opponent's lines. It works really well. But I need to include fiveOnFive5. Don with fiveByFive6. Maybe will add G time to fiveOnFive.
