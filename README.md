# NHLShiftStats4
This repo is update on my previous repo located here: https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftsStats3. I just started doing staff in a different way. Using objects and not arrays. Does not improve too much in fact using object takes more lines than arrays. Copied old script to start with. 
## Future Development
That's developing pretty well. I am progressing. Developed function lineByLine2 which is absolutely different from lineByLine1. And I found many errors that I did not see before. One example is game on 05/29. Had some issues with case when team dressed 11F. Not resolved in functions lineByLine1, lineByline2. So created lineByLine3 to count case when forwards 9 and 10 played as a line against opponent's lines. It works really well. But I need to include fiveOnFive5.

Games with 11F in March 2025: 03/01 game 1 A 11F, game 5 H 11F, 03/02 game 4 A 11F, 03/03 game 2 A 11F, game 3 A 11F, 03/08 game 0 H 11F, game 6 H 11F, 03/11 game 4 A 11F, game 10 11F, 3/15 game 3 A 11F, 3/17 game 1 H 11F, 3/20 game 7 A 11F game 8 A 11F, 3/22 game 2 11F, 3/23 game 4 A 11F, 3/24 game 1 H 11F, 3/25 game 2 H 11F, 3/27 game 0 A 11F, game 2 H 11F, game 8 A 11F, 3/28 game 1 A 11F, 3/29 game 1 H 11F, 3/30 game 7, 3/31 game 1 A 11F, 04/01 game 4, 04/03 game 1, 04/05 game 6, 04/06 game 6 H 11F, 4/7 game 0 A 11F, game 2 A 11F. 

Games with 11F in 2025-26 season, 10/09 game 0 CHI A 11F, game 10 A 11F, 10/11 game 10 A 11F, 10/13 game 9 H 11F, 10/30 game 2 all data missing, 09/11 game 0, game 3 11/12 H 11F, game 0 11/14, game 5 11/18, game 6 H 11/20. no new through 11/11

not sure why Ovie line in game 4 11/13/25 has 0 s in 1st period. Then why is it first line? Because it was 3rd period lineup. resolved but game 0 on 11/09 has an error. game 1 11/15 has error in away lines 3rd period, same game H line 3 numbers are different in two tables. game 0 11/16 error line 346. game 2 11/17 error line 60???. game 0 11/19 produces an error line 345 or so. Game 2 11/19 H team line 19-28-39 3rd period does not look right. Game 2 11/20 H team looks not right. game 5 11/20 error line 345. Then again game 10 11/20 line 19-20-91 in bottom table compare with 19-20-23 in top table. Game 0 11/21 error line 340.
