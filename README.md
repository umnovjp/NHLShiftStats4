# NHLShiftStats4
This repo is update on my previous repo located here: https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftsStats3. I just started doing staff in a different way. Using objects and not arrays. Does not improve too much in fact using object takes more lines than arrays. Copied old script to start with. 
## Future Development
That's developing pretty well. I am progressing. Developed function lineByLine2 which is absolutely different from lineByLine1. And I found many errors that I did not see before. One example is game on 05/29. Had some issues with case when team dressed 11F. Not resolved in functions lineByLine1, lineByline2. So created lineByLine3 to count case when forwards 9 and 10 played as a line against opponent's lines. It works really well. But I need to include fiveOnFive5.

Games with 11F in March 2025: 03/01 game 1 A 11F, game 5 H 11F, 03/02 game 4 A 11F, 03/03 game 2 A 11F, game 3 A 11F, 03/08 game 0 H 11F, game 6 H 11F, 03/11 game 4 A 11F, game 10 11F, 3/15 game 3 A 11F, 3/17 game 1 H 11F, 3/20 game 7 A 11F game 8 A 11F, 3/22 game 2 11F, 3/23 game 4 A 11F, 3/24 game 1 H 11F, 3/25 game 2 H 11F, 3/27 game 0 A 11F, game 2 H 11F, game 8 A 11F, 3/28 game 1 A 11F, 3/29 game 1 H 11F, 3/30 game 7, 3/31 game 1 A 11F, 04/01 game 4, 04/03 game 1, 04/05 game 6, 04/06 game 6 H 11F, 4/7 game 0 A 11F, game 2 A 11F.
