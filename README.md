# NHLShiftStats4
This repo is update on my previous repo located here: https://github.com/umnovjp/NHLShiftsStats3. I just started doing staff in a different way. Using objects and not arrays. Does not improve too much in fact using object takes more lines than arrays. Copied old script
## Future Development
That's developing pretty well. I am progressing. Next step is to find new lines array. Just cannot create this script. Expected to be easy. Today attempting to do update from different laptop.
